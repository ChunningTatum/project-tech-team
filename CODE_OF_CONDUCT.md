# Tools
The following tools will be used to communicate:

## Whatsapp
As a project group, we will inform each other about the continuation of our checklist. We will also be discussing assingnments and possibly report something in the group via WhatsApp.

## Discord
We will make the use of Discord to openly communicate with each other via the call function. Further links to external and internal resources will be shared with each other in the chatroom if neccesary.

## Githhub Projects
Assignments and to do lists will be marked in the Github Projects tab. Each 'to do' tab will be marked completed if the standards are met with the requirement.

## Github rules
* Individual features should be developed in thei're own respective branches.
* Every feater that is finished should always be pushed in to development and never in to master directly.
* Mergers from development into master, always has to be reviewed by other contributors and checked if everything still functions.
